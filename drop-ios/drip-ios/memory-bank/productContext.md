# Product Context: Drip - Hyper-personalized Fashion

## Problem Statement
Online shoppers frequently struggle with uncertainty about clothing fit, style compatibility, and quality, causing returns and dissatisfaction. Traditional online shopping platforms fail to personalize product discovery effectively—particularly for localized markets like India, where skin tones, body shapes, and style preferences vary dramatically.

## User Pain Points
1. **Fit Uncertainty**: Inconsistent sizing across brands leads to poor fit and returns
2. **Style Compatibility**: Difficulty finding items that match personal style and existing wardrobe
3. **Quality Assessment**: Inability to assess fabric quality and construction from online images
4. **Localization Gaps**: Global platforms don't account for regional preferences and body types
5. **Discovery Limitations**: Difficulty discovering niche or local brands that might be perfect matches

## Solution Approach
Drip addresses these challenges through a multi-agent AI system that:

1. **Discovers and Curates**: Finds high-quality fashion items from both established and niche brands
2. **Personalizes Recommendations**: Matches items to individual preferences, body types, and skin tones
3. **Provides Fit Guidance**: Analyzes reviews and product data to suggest optimal sizing
4. **Enhances Discovery**: Surfaces items that match user's style profile from brands they might not know
5. **Builds Confidence**: Provides detailed information about materials, construction, and fit

## User Experience Goals
- **Effortless Discovery**: Users should find items they love without extensive searching

4. **Niche Brand Enthusiasts**: Users who prefer unique, less-known brands but struggle to find them
