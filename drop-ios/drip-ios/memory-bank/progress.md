## Current Status
The project has made significant progress with both Fleet A and Fleet B implementations. Fleet A's in-memory vector database component has been implemented and tested, with a fallback mechanism for resilience. Fleet B has been fully implemented with all four agents (Stylist AI, Feedback & Refinement, Fit & Size Personalization, and Visual Generation) and a RESTful API for iOS app integration. The next focus is on completing the Database Indexer agent for Fleet A and adding authentication and security features to the API layer.

## Known Issues
1. **Vector Database Connectivity**: Occasional connection issues with Chroma, mitigated by in-memory fallback
2. **Embedding Quality**: Need to fine-tune the embedding generation for fashion-specific attributes
3. **Setup Process**: Setup scripts need better error handling and recovery
4. **Documentation**: Some components lack comprehensive documentation
5. **LangChain Template Variables**: Issues with f-string template variables in LangChain prompts (fixed)
6. **OpenAI Model Compatibility**: Issues with using OpenAI class with chat models like gpt-4o (fixed)
7. **Response Handling**: Need to properly handle responses from ChatOpenAI by accessing the content property
8. **External API Integration**: Need to handle rate limits and potential downtime of the Fashn.ai API

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Vector Database Selection
1. Initially planned to use Pinecone for vector database
2. Switched to Chroma for local development simplicity
3. Encountered issues with Chroma connectivity
4. Implemented in-memory vector database with fallback mechanism
5. Current approach: Hybrid solution with in-memory fallback for resilience

### Embedding Strategy
1. Initially considered OpenAI embeddings
2. Evaluated various embedding models for performance/accuracy balance
3. Selected HuggingFace Transformers with Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
4. Implemented custom text representation for fashion items
5. Added cosine similarity for vector comparison

### Architecture Approach
1. Started with monolithic design
2. Evolved to agent-based architecture for better separation of concerns
3. Implemented pipeline pattern for data flow
4. Added fallback mechanisms for resilience
5. Current approach: Multi-agent system with clear responsibilities and interfaces

### LangChain Integration
1. Initially used OpenAI class for all LLM interactions
2. Encountered compatibility issues with chat models
3. Switched to ChatOpenAI for all chat model interactions
4. Standardized prompt template usage across agents
5. Implemented best practices for template variable handling

## Next Milestones
1. Complete Fleet A implementation (ETA: 1-2 weeks)
2. Add authentication and security to API layer (ETA: 1 week)
3. Implement iOS app integration (ETA: 2-3 weeks)
4. Comprehensive testing of both fleets (ETA: 1 week)
5. Performance optimization for production (ETA: 1-2 weeks)
6. Create simple demonstration UI (ETA: 2 weeks)
