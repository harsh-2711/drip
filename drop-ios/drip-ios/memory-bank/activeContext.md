# Active Context: Drip - Hyper-personalized Fashion

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing and debugging Fleet B's API layer for iOS app integration. This includes fixing issues with the API endpoints and ensuring proper communication between the frontend and backend components.

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed OpenAI model compatibility issues in all Fleet B agents (switched from OpenAI to ChatOpenAI)
2. Fixed template variable issues in the Visual Generation agent
3. Resolved f-string template errors in mood board and outfit description generation
4. Updated API endpoints to handle responses from ChatOpenAI correctly
5. Implemented proper error handling for API routes
6. Updated Fleet B APIs according to new requirements in FLEET_B_UPGRADES.md
7. Integrated Fashn.ai API for virtual try-on functionality in the Visual Generation agent
8. Updated configuration to support Fashn.ai API key

## Active Decisions

### Vector Database Implementation
- **Decision**: Use an in-memory vector database with PostgreSQL instead of external vector DB services
- **Rationale**: Simplifies deployment, reduces dependencies, and provides sufficient performance for the MVP
- **Trade-offs**: May need to migrate to a more scalable solution in the future

### Embedding Model Selection
- **Decision**: Use Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings
- **Rationale**: Good balance between performance and accuracy, works well with the HuggingFace Transformers library
- **Implementation**: Using `@langchain/community/embeddings/hf_transformers` for embedding generation

### Resilience Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement in-memory fallback for vector operations
- **Rationale**: Ensures system can continue functioning even if the primary database is unavailable
- **Implementation**: Dual-write approach with fallback to in-memory store for queries

### LangChain Model Usage
- **Decision**: Use ChatOpenAI instead of OpenAI for all chat models
- **Rationale**: OpenAI class is not compatible with chat models like gpt-4o
- **Implementation**: Updated all agents to use ChatOpenAI with proper response handling

### Template Variable Handling
- **Decision**: Use JavaScript template literals for dynamic values in LangChain templates
- **Rationale**: Prevents "Invalid prompt schema" errors with f-string templates
- **Implementation**: Updated Visual Generation agent to use template literals for numImages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Develop a basic UI for testing Fleet B's API endpoints
2. Implement authentication and security for the API layer
3. Create comprehensive API documentation for iOS developers
4. Add error handling and validation for API requests
5. Implement logging for API usage and performance monitoring

### Short-term Goals
1. Complete the Database Indexer agent implementation for Fleet A
2. Integrate Fleet A and Fleet B for end-to-end functionality
3. Implement iOS app integration with Fleet B's API
4. Create a demonstration UI for showcasing the system's capabilities
5. Add performance optimization for production deployment

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Embedding Quality**: Ensuring embeddings capture the nuanced fashion attributes
2. **Query Performance**: Optimizing vector similarity search for real-time recommendations
3. **Data Quality**: Handling inconsistent or missing data from scraped sources
4. **Scalability**: Preparing for growth in the product database
5. **API Security**: Implementing proper authentication and authorization for the API
6. **iOS Integration**: Ensuring smooth communication between the iOS app and backend API
7. **LangChain Compatibility**: Managing compatibility issues between LangChain versions and OpenAI models
8. **Template Handling**: Properly handling template variables in LangChain prompts

### Implementation Insights
1. The in-memory vector database provides good performance for the current dataset size
2. Cosine similarity works well for fashion item similarity calculations
3. Structured representation of fashion items improves embedding quality
4. Fallback mechanisms are essential for system reliability

## Key Learnings

### Vector Database Implementation
- In-memory vector databases can be effective for MVPs and smaller datasets
- Proper embedding generation is crucial for semantic search quality
- Hybrid search (combining vector and traditional filtering) provides the best results

### System Architecture
- Agent-based architecture provides good separation of concerns
- Pipeline approach simplifies data flow and error handling
- Fallback mechanisms improve system resilience

### LangChain Integration
- ChatOpenAI must be used for all OpenAI chat models (not OpenAI class)
- JavaScript template literals work better than LangChain variables for values known at template creation time
- Proper error handling is essential for LangChain chains
- JSON parsing requires careful handling of response formats

### API Development
- RESTful API design provides a clean interface for frontend integration
- Proper validation of request bodies prevents errors
- Consistent error response format improves frontend error handling
- API documentation is crucial for frontend developers

## Current Status
- Fleet A: Vector database implementation is functional with in-memory fallback
- Fleet B: All agents implemented (Stylist AI, Feedback & Refinement, Fit & Size Personalization, Visual Generation)
- API Layer: RESTful API endpoints created for Fleet B agents
- Fixed compatibility issues with OpenAI models and template variables
- API server is running and ready for iOS app integration
- Next focus is on UI development for demonstration and testing
