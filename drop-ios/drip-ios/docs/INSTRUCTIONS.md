# Problem title
Drip: Hyper-personalized Fashion

# Problem overview*
Online shoppers frequently struggle with uncertainty about clothing fit, style compatibility, and quality, causing returns and dissatisfaction. Traditional online shopping platforms fail to personalize product discovery effectivelyâ€”particularly for localized markets like India, where skin tones, body shapes, and style preferences vary dramatically. Solving this will boost consumer confidence, elevate local brands, and drastically reduce returns.

# Proposed AI approach
## 1. Skin Color Detection:
OpenAI's GPT-4.5 along with Monk Skin Tone Scale

## 2. AI Agent Fleet Architecture (powered by GPT-4.5):
### Fleet A: Data Preparation Agents
- Agent A (Discovery): Uses GPT-4.5-driven web-crawling agents (powered by tools like LangChain + Playwright) to fetch trendy, premium clothing brands and products from selected verified Indian and international luxury websites.
- Agent B (Parsing & Cleaning): Intelligently parse raw HTML product data (images, prices, descriptions, sizing guides) into structured formats.
- Agent C (Quality Filtering): Filters items strictly by predefined luxury and aesthetic standards (trained by current trends on clothing aesthetics).

### Data Storage Layer:
Structured embedding of products into a vector database for fast semantic search and retrieval based on user prompts.

### Fleet B: User Interaction & Recommendation Agents
- Agent E (Real-Time Recommendation Engine): Dynamically matching user preferences (styles, colors, fits) against vector database entries.

- Agent F (Conversational Refinement): Interact conversationally, refining results continuously based on real-time user feedback ("show linen pants instead," "avoid skinny jeans").

### Aspirational component:
- Agent D (Review Parsing & Size Estimation): Uses GPT-4.5-powered review analysis to simulate crowd-sourced sizing suggestions, normalizing fit accuracy across different brands.

- Agent G (Dynamic Size Suggestions): GPT-4.5 accurately predicts personalized size recommendations using user's body analysis and previously parsed sizing information from reviews.

- Agent H (Visual Generation): GPT-4.5 (with OpenAI Image Generation) to visualize alternative clothing combinations and styling suggestions dynamically.

## Why this approach?
- Modular & Scalable: AI agents ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable separation of concerns.

- Fast Prototyping: Using GPT-4.5 and agent frameworks (LangGraph/LangChain) allows rapid building and iteration within hackathon timelines.

- High Accuracy: GPT-4.5 outperforms traditional ML models in nuanced tasks such as review parsing, complex conversational interactions, and size estimations.

# Success metrics
- Fit accuracy: User-reported satisfaction with recommended size and fit (target: 90%+ satisfaction).

- Engagement: Percentage of recommendations positively engaged with (liked, swiped right, or purchased).

- Return-rate reduction: Aiming for 30-50% reduction compared to industry-standard returns.

- User Retention: Number of users consistently returning for recommendations (weekly/monthly active users).

- Seller Impact: Number of niche/local brands discovered by users and increase in their sales volume post-integration.

# Scope & boundaries
## Assumptions:
1. Users will upload clear, well-lit photos suitable for AI analysis.
2. The app starts with a limited, curated database of premium Indian and international luxury products for demo purposes.
3. Size suggestions initially rely on approximations from simulated review analysis, not real-time parsing (due to demo constraints).

## Out-of-Scope (Hackathon Timeline Constraints):
1. Real-time scraping of live retailer reviews at scale.
2. End-to-end Virtual AR try-on integration (considered aspirational for now).
3. Direct, fully-integrated payment and shipping functionalities.
4. Full production-scale database with thousands of products (only a curated set demoed initially).
